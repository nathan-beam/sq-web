Usage:
  sq config set conn.max-idle 2

Set the maximum number of connections in the idle connection pool. If
conn.max-open is greater than 0 but less than the new conn.max-idle, then the
new conn.max-idle will be reduced to match the conn.max-open limit.

If n <= 0, no idle connections are retained.
