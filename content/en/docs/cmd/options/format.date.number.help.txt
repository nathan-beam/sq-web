Usage:
  sq config set format.date.number true

Render numeric date value as number instead of string, if possible.
If format.date renders a numeric value (e.g. a year such as "1979"), that value
is typically rendered as a string. For some output formats, such as JSON, it can
be useful to instead render the value as a naked number instead of a string.
Note that this option is no-op if the rendered value is not an integer.

  format.date.number=false
  [{"first_name":"PENELOPE","birth_year":"1979"}]
  format.date.number=true
  [{"first_name":"PENELOPE","birth_year":1979}]
