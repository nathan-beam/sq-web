Usage:
  sq config set format.time TimeOnly

Time format. This can be one of several predefined constants such
as "TimeOnly" or "Unix", or a strftime format such as "%Y-%m-%d".
Note that time values are sometimes programmatically indistinguishable
from datetime values. In that situation, use format.datetime instead.

Predefined values:
  ANSIC, DateOnly, DateTime, ISO8601, ISO8601Z, RFC1123, RFC1123Z,
  RFC3339, RFC3339Nano, RFC3339Z, RFC822, RFC822Z, RFC850,
  TimeOnly, Unix, UnixDate, UnixMicro, UnixMilli, UnixNano
