Usage:
  sq config set diff.max-hunk-size 5000

Maximum size of individual diff hunks. A hunk is a segment of a diff that
contains differing lines, as well as non-differing context lines before and
after the difference. A hunk must be loaded into memory in its entirety; this
setting prevents excessive memory usage. If a hunk would exceed this limit, it
is split into multiple hunks; this still produces a well-formed diff.
