Usage:
  sq config set shell-completion.log false

Enable logging of shell completion activity. It is frequently the case
that shell completion handlers will trigger work (such as inspecting
the schema) that doesn't complete by the shell completion timeout. This can result
in the logs being filled with uninteresting junk when the timeout triggers
logging of errors due to the cancellation.
