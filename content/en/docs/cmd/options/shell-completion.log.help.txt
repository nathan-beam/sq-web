Usage:
  sq config set shell-completion.log false

Enable logging of shell completion activity. This is really only useful
for debugging shell completion functionality. It's disabled by default,
because it's frequently the case that shell completion handlers will trigger
work (such as inspecting the schema) that doesn't complete by the shell
completion timeout. This can result in the logs being filled with uninteresting
junk when the timeout triggers logging of errors due to the cancellation.
