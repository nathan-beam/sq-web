Usage:
  sq config set tuning.errgroup-limit 16

Controls the maximum number of goroutines that can be spawned
by an errgroup. Note that this is the limit for any one errgroup, but not a
ceiling on the total number of goroutines spawned, as some errgroups may
themselves start an errgroup.

This knob is primarily for internal use. Ultimately it should go away
in favor of dynamic errgroup limit setting based on availability
of additional DB conns, etc.
