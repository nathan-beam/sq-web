Usage:
  sq config set format.excel.datetime 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm'

Timestamp format for datetime values: that is, for values that have
both a date and time component. The exact format is specific to
Microsoft Excel, but is broadly similar to strftime.

Examples:

  "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm"           1989-11-09 16:07
  "dd/mm/yy h:mm am/pm"        09/11/89 4:07 pm
  "dd-mmm-yy h:mm:ss AM/PM"    09-Nov-89 4:07:01 PM
