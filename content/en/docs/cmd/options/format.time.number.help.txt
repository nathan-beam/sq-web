Usage:
  sq config set format.time.number true

Render numeric time value as number instead of string, if possible.
If format.time renders a numeric value (e.g. "59"), that value
is typically rendered as a string. For some output formats, such as JSON, it can
be useful to instead render the value as a naked number instead of a string.
Note that this option is no-op if the rendered value is not an integer.

  format.time.number=false
  [{"first_name":"PENELOPE","favorite_minute":"59"}]
  format.time.number=true
  [{"first_name":"PENELOPE","favorite_minute":59}]
