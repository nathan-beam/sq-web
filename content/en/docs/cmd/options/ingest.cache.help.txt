Usage:
  sq config set ingest.cache true


Specifies whether ingested data is cached or not, on a global or per-source
basis. When data is ingested from a document source, it is stored in a cache DB.
Subsequent uses of that same source will use that cached DB instead of ingesting
the data again, unless this option is set to false, in which case, the data is
ingested each time.

  # Set default ingest caching behavior
  $ sq config set ingest.cache false

	# Set ingest caching behavior for a specific source
	$ sq config set --src @sakila ingest.cache false
