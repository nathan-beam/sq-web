Usage:
  sq config set ingest.cache true

Specifies whether ingested data is cached or not. When data is ingested
from a document source, it is stored in a cache DB. Subsequent uses of that same
source will use that cached DB instead of ingesting the data again, unless this
option is set to false, in which case, the data is ingested each time.
