Usage:
  sq config set format.excel.time hh:mm:ss

Time format string for Microsoft Excel time-only values. The exact format is
specific to Excel, but is broadly similar to strftime.

Examples:

  "hh:mm:ss"         16:07:10
  "h:mm am/pm"	     4:07 pm
  "h:mm:ss AM/PM"    4:07:01 PM

Note that time-only values are sometimes programmatically indistinguishable
from datetime values. In that situation, use format.excel.datetime instead.
