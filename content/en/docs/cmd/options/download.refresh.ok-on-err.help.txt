Usage:
  sq config set download.refresh.ok-on-err true

Continue with stale download if refresh fails. This option applies if a download
is in the cache, but is considered stale, and a refresh attempt fails. If set to
true, the refresh error is logged, and the stale download is returned. This is a
sort of "Airplane Mode" for downloads: when true, sq continues with the cached
download when the network is unavailable. If false, an error is returned instead.
