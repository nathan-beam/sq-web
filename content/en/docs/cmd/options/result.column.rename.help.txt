Usage:
  sq config set result.column.rename '{{.Name}}{{with .Recurrence}}_{{.}}{{end}}'

This Go text template is executed on the column names returned
from the DB. Its primary purpose is to rename duplicate column names. For
example, given a query that results in this SQL:

  SELECT * FROM actor JOIN film_actor ON actor.actor_id = film_actor.actor_id

The returned result set will have these column names:

  actor_id, first_name, last_name, last_update, actor_id, film_id, last_update
  |-              from "actor"               -| |-    from "film_actor"     -|

Note the duplicate "actor_id" and "last_update" column names. When output in a
format (such as JSON) that doesn't permit duplicate keys, only one of each
duplicate column could appear.

The fields available in the template are:

  .Name         column name
  .Index        zero-based index of the column in the result set
  .Recurrence   nth recurrence of the colum name in the result set

For a unique column name, e.g. "first_name" above, ".Recurrence" will be 0.
For duplicate column names, ".Recurrence" will be 0 for the first instance,
then 1 for the next instance, and so on.

The default template renames the columns to:

  actor_id, first_name, last_name, last_update, actor_id_1, film_id, last_update_1
