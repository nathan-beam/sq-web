Move/rename sources and groups.

The mv command works analogously to the UNIX "mv" command, where
source handles are files, and groups are directories.

Usage:
  sq mv OLD NEW [flags]

Examples:
  # Rename a source
  $ sq mv @sakila_postgres @sakila_pg
  @sakila_pg

  # Move a source into a group (same as renaming)
  $ sq mv @sakila_pg @sakila/pg
  @sakila/pg

  # Move a source into a group, keep current name
  $ sq mv @sakila/pg prod
  @prod/pg

  # Rename the group "production" to "prod". This will rename
  # any sources already in that group.
  $ sq mv production prod

Flags:
      --help   help for mv

Global Flags:
  -M, --monochrome   Don't colorize output
  -v, --verbose      Print verbose outputaa
